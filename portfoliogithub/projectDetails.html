                Earlier this year I created an HTML/CSS website that was made for a fast food restaurant and I had full creative freedom to design how I wished as well as put my own spin on the items you can order.

                In my personal work I focus heavily of finding other creative outputs such as on my instagram portfolio I display other works I have done. From custom shoes and skate boards to 3d models in blender.
