            <h3>my interests</h3>
            <p>In my current studies, we have focused heavily on creating websites from scratch using code and software such as Python, databases, CSS, bootstrap and HTML. through this I have understood which side of development I would like to be on, which has opened doors into another field I would like to investigate further. Through my studies, they have shown that technical subjects such as information technology and computer science do not all have to be lines upon lines of code that most individuals believe it is.</p>
            <P>This has led me to become interested in a more creative side of information technology, such as front-end development in websites, visual design, game design or even product packaging design. These fields have interested me for a while, some of these fields more than others. game design, for example, has always intrigued me due to how I grew up and seeing the impact some games can have on individuals. This makes me feel I will have the ability to use creativity more freely, and reach more individuals visually. The same points can be made for each of the fields I have suggested as they all heavily rely on visual appeal and design.</P>
